# Forest-Fire-Prediction-Using-ML
Forest fires results in a danger to lives, properties, and environment. This project proposes a system that 
leverages machine learning (ML) to predict forest fire risk and implement mitigation strategies. The system will utilize 
historical data on weather conditions, vegetation, topography, and past fire occurrences. By training various ML 
algorithms, the system will identify patterns and relationships that contribute to fire risk i.e. oxygen level, 
temperature, and humidity. The predicted fire risk will be displayed on a user-friendly interface, allowing forest 
authorities to prioritize resource allocation for prevention and early intervention. The successful implementation of 
this system can significantly reduce the devastating impacts of forest fires.
